## R Shiny file copier

I had an idea some time ago to create an R Shiny app that would let me quickly perform a few key actions before starting class each day:

1. Copy the day's exercise file from the main course repo (private) to the JupyterHub repo (private).
2. Automate the process of staging, committing, and pushing the changes from the JupyterHub local repo to remote.

This code represents the current state of that side project.
